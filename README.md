# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Rodrigo Ansanello Arvolea

Repository created for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Course.

# Overview

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
I will be graded by my peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. I will be required to submit: 
1) a tidy data set,
2) a link to a Github repository with my script for performing the analysis, and 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. 

I should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected. 

# Project Summary - Instructions

I should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Additional Information

You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
